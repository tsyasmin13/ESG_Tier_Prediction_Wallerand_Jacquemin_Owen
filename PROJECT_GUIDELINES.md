# 4. Project Workflow (Recommended)

Students should follow this workflow when working on their project.

---

## Step 1 — Problem Definition

Clearly define:

- What you want to **predict or explain**
- What are the **input variables**
- What is the **target variable**

Examples:

| Task | Example |
|-----|------|
| Classification | Predict default of a borrower |
| Regression | Predict stock return |
| Time Series | Predict interest rates |
| NLP | Predict market movement from news |

---

## Step 2 — Data Exploration

Before building models, you must **understand the dataset**.

Recommended steps:

- Inspect variables
- Plot distributions
- Check correlations
- Identify missing values
- Detect anomalies or outliers

Example tools:

```python
df.describe()
df.info()
sns.histplot()
sns.heatmap()
```

Questions you should answer:

- Are there missing values?
- Are variables normally distributed?
- Are some variables strongly correlated?

---

## Step 3 — Data Preprocessing

Typical preprocessing tasks:

### Missing values
- Remove rows
- Imputation (mean, median, model-based)

### Feature scaling

Common methods:

- Standardization
- Min-max scaling

### Encoding categorical variables

- One-hot encoding
- Label encoding

### Train/Test split

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

---

## Step 4 — Feature Engineering

Feature engineering often **improves performance more than complex models**.

Examples:

### Financial features
- Returns
- Volatility
- Moving averages

### Time series features
- Lag variables
- Rolling statistics

### Text features
- TF-IDF
- Word embeddings

Example:

```python
df["return"] = df["price"].pct_change()
df["ma_5"] = df["price"].rolling(5).mean()
```

---

## Step 5 — Modeling

You are encouraged to **test multiple models**.

### Regression models

- Linear Regression
- Ridge / Lasso

### Classification models

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

### Neural networks

- MLP
- LSTM (for time series)
- Transformers (for NLP)

Example:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

## Step 6 — Model Evaluation

Choose evaluation metrics depending on the task.

### Classification

| Metric | Meaning |
|------|------|
| Accuracy | Overall correctness |
| Precision | Correct positive predictions |
| Recall | Detection ability |
| F1-score | Precision/Recall balance |
| AUC | Ranking performance |

### Regression

| Metric | Meaning |
|------|------|
| RMSE | Error magnitude |
| MAE | Absolute error |
| R² | Explained variance |

Example:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
```

---

## Step 7 — Model Interpretation

Understanding the model is **very important**.

You should attempt to analyze:

- Feature importance
- Model sensitivity
- Economic interpretation

Useful tools:

- SHAP
- LIME
- Feature importance plots

Example:

```python
model.feature_importances_
```
